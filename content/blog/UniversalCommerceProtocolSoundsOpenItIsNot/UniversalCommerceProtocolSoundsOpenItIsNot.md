## Universal Commerce Protocol, or UCP, sounds like a good idea

One protocol for commerce. Open. Standardized. Ready for AI. Companies can expose products and services to AI agents. AI can search, compare, and even buy on behalf of users.

On paper, this is progress. In reality, it smells like the next step where small businesses slowly disappear.

## Machines Do Not Browse Like Humans

1. Humans explore
2. Machines filter

### AI systems do not enjoy small websites

They do not care about story, craft, or passion. They want:

- clean APIs
- stable data
- fast responses
- clear pricing
- zero uncertainty

Big companies can deliver this. Small shops usually can not.

If your data is not perfect, you are skipped. If you are skipped, you do not exist.

## Visibility Moves From Search to Infrastructure

### Before, you needed SEO

Now, you need machine readiness. That means:

- APIs
- uptime
- schemas
- constant updates

This is not free. It needs time, people, and money.

A small painter selling hand made art can not compete here. Amazon can.

So the AI will find Amazon. Not because it is better. Because it is easier.

## Open Protocol, Closed Reality

### Yes, UCP is open

But openness does not remove power imbalance. Big companies will build:

- SDKs
- hosted gateways
- managed services

Small businesses will depend on those tools to stay visible.

This is vendor lock-in without a contract. You are free to leave. You just disappear if you do.

## Platforms Will Sell For You. With or Without You

### AI agents can buy on behalf of users

Marketplaces love this.

### We already see platforms selling products without permission

- The brand does not control pricing.
- The brand does not control presentation.

### The platform owns the customer

- Small businesses do not have lawyers.
- They accept it or they vanish.

## Margins Will Die Quietly

### AI access is not free

There will be:

- listing fees
- transaction fees
- ranking fees
- integration costs

Big companies spread this cost. Small ones feel it directly.

More sales. Less profit. More dependency.

## Trust Favors the Biggest Player

### AI systems prefer safe choices

Safe means:

- known brands
- stable delivery
- legal coverage

### The machine will choose safety

Again and again.

- A small shop is risky.
- A big platform is safe.

## UCP Solves Problems For the Big Ones

### UCP is not evil

It is well designed. But it solves problems that big companies already have.

Small businesses get new problems instead:

- more complexity
- less visibility
- less control

The protocol is open. The outcome is not.

## Maybe I Am Too Pessimistic

1. Maybe small vendors will adapt.
2. Maybe tools will become easier.
3. Maybe AI will learn to value diversity.

### Or maybe we repeat the same story again

Just faster. And quieter.

### What do you think?

Is Universal Commerce Protocol a real chance for small businesses or just another step where platforms take everything in between?

I am curious to hear other opinions.
