## Visual Studio Code docs on MCP servers and Agents

The Visual Studio Code docs on **MCP servers** show how to supercharge GitHub Copilot's agent mode by plugging in external tools using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

---

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open standard that lets AI communicate with tools and services via a unified interface. With MCP-compatible servers hooked up to VS Code, Copilot can do more than just suggest code â€“ it can:

- Run file operations
- Access databases
- Make API calls

All directly inside your editor.

---

## The Guide Covers:

- Setting up MCP servers
- Configuring them in VS Code
- Managing the whole integration

It also explains what types of servers are supported and how to use MCP tools in **agent mode**.

The goal?
> Smoother workflows, smarter tooling, and more time for building cool stuff.

## Sample MCP Servers I Use

Here are a few MCP servers I currently have configured:

- **Atlassian integration** (Jira & Confluence): [`sooperset/mcp-atlassian`](https://github.com/sooperset/mcp-atlassian)
- **NX integration** for monorepos: [`nx-mcp`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)

More MCP servers are available here: ðŸ‘‰ [List of MCP Servers](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)

## Secure Setup Tips

When setting up your `mcp.json`, you might worry about exposing settings.
To hide your MCP server variables securely, follow this flow:

```JSON
{
  "inputs": [{
    "id": "atl_token",
    "type": "promptString",
    "password": true,
    "description": "Enter your Atlassian Jira and Confluence token"
  },{
    "id": "BS_user",
    "type": "promptString",
    "password": false,
    "description": "Enter your BS User"
  },{
    "id": "BS_token",
    "type": "promptString",
    "password": true,
    "description": "Enter your BS token"
  }],
}
```

> This will ask for secrets at server start and remember them.
> Use placeholder variables in your config (e.g., `${input:atl_token}`).

```JSON
"CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN": "${input:atl_token}",
```

## Project-Specific Instructions for Copilot

GitHub Copilot now supports a `.github/copilot-instructions.md` file in your repo to tailor responses to your tools, workflows, and coding style.

### How to Set It Up

1. Create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in your repository root
2. Write clear, natural-language instructions in Markdown

> Copilot will now include these automatically in its responses.

### How to Check Itâ€™s Working

Look for `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in the **References** section of Copilot Chat responses.

## Custom Prompts (Optional)

You can also create prompt files like `.github/prompts/promts_Example.md`. These files guide Copilot to align with your coding style, frameworks, and project needs, enhancing its suggestions. For more details, [visit the official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/copilot-customization).

## Additional specialized Instructions

Additionally two files are available that you can configure in your Settings.json with the following settings. The names alone explain what they are for.

```JSON
"github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
  {
    "file": ".github/code-style.md"
  }
],
"github.copilot.chat.testGeneration.instructions": [
  {
    "file": ".github/test-style.md"
  }
]
```
