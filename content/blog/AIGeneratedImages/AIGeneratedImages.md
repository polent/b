## The New Wave of Picture Making

Lately, there's a big increase in pictures made by AI (Artificial Intelligence) on the internet. This change is reshaping the way we see and use pictures online. AI is getting really good at making images that look real, and it's getting hard to tell what's real and what's not.

## How This Affects Image Search Engines

Search engines like Google and Bing, which used to have mostly real pictures, are now full of these AI-made images. Some people think these AI images are just filling up space and are hard to separate from real ones. But, this view might miss out on the bigger picture and what AI images can do.

## A Personal View

### Imaginary Cats and What We Think is Real

Imagine if I posted pictures of cats drawn by my daughter when she was three. These aren't real cats, but if they get popular online, they might end up in search engines as if they were real cat pictures. This shows how AI can make fake images that seem real.

## The Big Problem

### Telling What's True from What's Made Up

The real problem comes with more tricky things, like a made-up picture of a famous person building sandcastles on the beach. Figuring out if these complex fake images are real or not needs us to be more careful and smart.

## How We Figure Out What's Real

We've always used our own judgement to check if what we see is real. This includes comparing different sources, looking for more proof, and using common sense. With AI-made images, it's even more important to use these skills.

## The Problem with Telling AI Pictures Apart

Some people think search engines shouldn't show AI-made images. But this is a simple answer to a complicated problem. The real issue is not just about filtering out AI stuff, but about teaching people how to think critically about the images they see.

## Conclusion

### Adapting to Change with Awareness

As AI keeps growing, we need to change how we handle information. We should accept AI-made images as part of our online world, but also get better at questioning and understanding them. In a world full of fake creations, our own thinking and judgement are the best tools we have. This won't be easy, but it's necessary.
