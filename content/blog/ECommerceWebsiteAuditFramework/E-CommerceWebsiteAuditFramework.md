## TL;DR

This framework provides a comprehensive audit method for e-commerce websites. It covers SEO, performance, accessibility, front-end code, architecture, security, integrations, documentation, and operations. Each section includes sample do’s and don’ts, recommended tools, and evaluation criteria. These examples are illustrative only; in real audits, there are many more program-, client-, and project-specific checks. Deliverables include an executive summary, a detailed findings report, and a scorecard (1–5 rating) to prioritize fixes.

## Deliverables of the Audit

- **Executive Summary** for stakeholders
- **Detailed findings** with “Do/Don’t” recommendations
- **Scorecards** for SEO, performance, accessibility, security, etc.
- **Actionable roadmap** with priorities (Quick Wins vs. Long-Term Fixes)

### Example Deliverables

#### Executive Summary (Example)

**Project:** Audit of “ShopNow E-Commerce”
**Date:** September 2025

The audit identified several strengths in the current platform, including a scalable cloud architecture and good API documentation. However, there are significant gaps in accessibility, performance, and security.

- **Accessibility**: The site does not meet WCAG 2.1 AA. Missing alt text, poor contrast, and keyboard traps were found. This limits usability for a portion of users and poses compliance risks.
- **Performance**: Load times on mobile devices are slow (LCP ~4.2s). Large unoptimized images and render-blocking scripts are the main issues.
- **Security**: Outdated libraries with known vulnerabilities were detected. No CSP headers are set, leaving the site vulnerable to XSS attacks.
- **SEO**: Overall strong, but duplicate meta descriptions and missing structured data for products reduce search visibility.

**Recommended Roadmap:**

- **Quick Wins (0–3 months):** Fix image optimization, apply security headers, add alt text.
- **Mid-Term (3–6 months):** Upgrade dependency management, add Lighthouse CI in pipeline, implement automated accessibility checks.
- **Long-Term (6+ months):** Redesign color palette for accessibility, adopt service mesh for API resilience, build observability dashboards.

#### Scorecard (Example, 1–5 Rating)

| Category        | Rating (1–5) | Notes                                                                 |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SEO             | 3            | Indexing is fine, but missing structured data and duplicate metas.   |
| Performance     | 2            | Mobile performance weak (LCP > 4s), no CDN usage.                    |
| Accessibility   | 1            | WCAG compliance poor, several critical blockers.                     |
| Frontend Code   | 3            | Semantics okay, but CSS unstructured, JS bundles too large.           |
| Architecture    | 4            | Modular and scalable, but observability limited.                     |
| Security        | 2            | Outdated libs, missing CSP and secure headers.                       |
| Integrations    | 4            | APIs well documented, retry logic missing in payments.               |
| Documentation   | 3            | Good developer docs, but no audit or ADRs kept updated.              |
| Processes/Ops   | 4            | CI/CD pipeline in place, but no DevSecOps or automated scans.        |

**Legend:**

- 1 = Critical (high risk, urgent fix needed)
- 2 = Weak (many gaps, below industry standard)
- 3 = Acceptable (meets minimum expectations, needs improvements)
- 4 = Strong (good practice, minor improvements possible)
- 5 = Excellent (industry leading, no action needed)
