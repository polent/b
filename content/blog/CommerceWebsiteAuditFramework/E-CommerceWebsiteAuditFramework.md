## 1. SEO & Online Visibility

**What to check:** On-page optimization, structured data, crawlability, and search performance.

✅ **Do**

- Use descriptive page titles & unique meta descriptions.
- Add structured data (schema.org for products, reviews, breadcrumbs).
- Submit XML sitemaps to Google Search Console.

❌ **Don’t**

- Stuff keywords unnaturally.
- Use duplicate content across product pages.
- Block important content with robots.txt.

### SEO Tools

- Browser: [Lighthouse SEO Audit](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse)
- SaaS: SEMrush, Ahrefs, Screaming Frog
- Agentic: AI-based tools (e.g. Surfer SEO for content optimization)

## 2. Performance & Scalability

**What to check:** Speed, resource usage, and ability to handle growth.

✅ **Do**

- Optimize images (WebP/AVIF, responsive sizes).
- Minify and bundle JS/CSS carefully.
- Use a CDN for global delivery.

❌ **Don’t**

- Load blocking scripts in `<head>`.
- Ignore mobile performance (LCP > 2.5s is bad).
- Rely only on vertical scaling instead of elasticity.

### Performance Tools

- Browser: Chrome DevTools (Performance tab)
- SaaS: WebPageTest, GTmetrix, SpeedCurve
- CI/CD: Lighthouse CI, k6 for load testing

## 3. Accessibility

**What to check:** Compliance with WCAG 2.1+ and real-world usability.

✅ **Do**

- Provide alt text for all images.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (use a contrast checker).
- Make all functionality accessible via keyboard.

❌ **Don’t**

- Convey information only by color.
- Hide focus outlines.
- Skip ARIA roles where needed.

### Accessibility Tools

- Browser: axe DevTools, WAVE, Lighthouse Accessibility Audit
- Automated: Pa11y CI
- Manual: Screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)

(Reference: Publicis Sapient CoE Accessibility in Canada – “[Accessibility for All(https://www.publicissapient.com/insights/liberty-accessibility-for-all)]” initiative)

## 4. Front-End Code Quality

**What to check:** Clean, maintainable, and performant code.

✅ **Do**

- Write semantic HTML (`<button>`, not `<div onclick>`).
- Use CSS naming conventions (e.g. BEM).
- Split JS bundles and lazy load non-critical code.

❌ **Don’t**

- Mix styling inline (`style=""`).
- Abuse `!important` in CSS.
- Depend on large frameworks for trivial functionality.

### Quality Tools

- Static Analysis: ESLint, Stylelint
- Browser: Coverage tab in DevTools (unused CSS/JS)
- CI/CD: SonarQube for code quality

## 5. Software Architecture

**What to check:** Scalability, modularity, and resilience.

✅ **Do**

- Apply Domain-Driven Design for modularity.
- Version APIs and document them (Swagger, OpenAPI).
- Add observability (structured logging, distributed tracing).

❌ **Don’t**

- Couple business logic tightly with UI.
- Skip caching strategies (API + DB).
- Forget failure recovery (retry, circuit breaker).

### Architecture Tools

- Code Level: Architecture Decision Records (ADR), PlantUML diagrams
- Monitoring: Datadog, New Relic, OpenTelemetry
- Testing: Postman/Newman for APIs

## 6. Security

**What to check:** Protect against vulnerabilities, compliance with standards.

✅ **Do**

- Use HTTPS everywhere (HSTS enabled).
- Hash and salt passwords (bcrypt, Argon2).
- Apply least privilege to user roles.

❌ **Don’t**

- Store secrets in code.
- Trust client-side validation alone.
- Disable security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options).

### Security Tools

- Browser: Security tab in Chrome DevTools
- Code Level: OWASP Dependency-Check, Snyk
- SaaS: Burp Suite, ZAP (DAST scans)

## 7. Integrations & APIs

**What to check:** Reliability and compliance of third-party systems.

✅ **Do**

- Implement retry & backoff strategies.
- Secure APIs with OAuth2/JWT.
- Use monitoring for payment/logistics APIs.

❌ **Don’t**

- Hardcode API keys.
- Skip sandbox testing before production release.
- Assume vendor APIs never change.

### Integrations Tools

- Postman, Insomnia (manual testing)
- Pact (contract testing)
- WireMock (API mocking)

## 8. Documentation & Governance

**What to check:** Knowledge sharing, standards, and process.

✅ **Do**

- Maintain a living API spec.
- Document architecture decisions.
- Include audit reports with scoring and remediation.

❌ **Don’t**

- Let docs go stale.
- Hide findings in long PDFs with no clear action plan.
- Forget to track NFRs in backlog.

### Documentation Tools

- Confluence, Notion, or GitHub Wiki
- ADR templates (Architectural Decision Records)
- Scorecards & dashboards (e.g. Grafana)

## 9. Processes & Operations

**What to check:** Deployment, monitoring, and resilience.

✅ **Do**

- Automate testing in CI/CD (unit, integration, regression).
- Add DevSecOps scanning to the pipeline.
- Define SLAs and measure them with monitoring.

❌ **Don’t**

- Deploy directly to production without review.
- Ignore alert fatigue (too many false alarms).
- Skip cost monitoring for cloud services.

### Process Tools

- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins
- Observability: Prometheus + Grafana, ELK Stack
- Incident Mgmt: PagerDuty, OpsGenie

## Deliverables of the Audit

- **Executive Summary** for stakeholders
- **Detailed findings** with “Do/Don’t” recommendations
- **Scorecards** for SEO, performance, accessibility, security, etc.
- **Actionable roadmap** with priorities (Quick Wins vs. Long-Term Fixes)

### Example Deliverables

#### Executive Summary (Example)

**Project:** Audit of “ShopNow E-Commerce”
**Date:** September 2025

The audit identified several strengths in the current platform, including a scalable cloud architecture and good API documentation. However, there are significant gaps in accessibility, performance, and security.

- **Accessibility**: The site does not meet WCAG 2.1 AA. Missing alt text, poor contrast, and keyboard traps were found. This limits usability for a portion of users and poses compliance risks.
- **Performance**: Load times on mobile devices are slow (LCP ~4.2s). Large unoptimized images and render-blocking scripts are the main issues.
- **Security**: Outdated libraries with known vulnerabilities were detected. No CSP headers are set, leaving the site vulnerable to XSS attacks.
- **SEO**: Overall strong, but duplicate meta descriptions and missing structured data for products reduce search visibility.

**Recommended Roadmap:**

- **Quick Wins (0–3 months):** Fix image optimization, apply security headers, add alt text.
- **Mid-Term (3–6 months):** Upgrade dependency management, add Lighthouse CI in pipeline, implement automated accessibility checks.
- **Long-Term (6+ months):** Redesign color palette for accessibility, adopt service mesh for API resilience, build observability dashboards.

#### Scorecard (Example, 1–5 Rating)

| Category        | Rating (1–5) | Notes                                                                 |
|-----------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| SEO             | 3            | Indexing is fine, but missing structured data and duplicate metas.   |
| Performance     | 2            | Mobile performance weak (LCP > 4s), no CDN usage.                    |
| Accessibility   | 1            | WCAG compliance poor, several critical blockers.                     |
| Frontend Code   | 3            | Semantics okay, but CSS unstructured, JS bundles too large.           |
| Architecture    | 4            | Modular and scalable, but observability limited.                     |
| Security        | 2            | Outdated libs, missing CSP and secure headers.                       |
| Integrations    | 4            | APIs well documented, retry logic missing in payments.               |
| Documentation   | 3            | Good developer docs, but no audit or ADRs kept updated.              |
| Processes/Ops   | 4            | CI/CD pipeline in place, but no DevSecOps or automated scans.        |

**Legend:**

- 1 = Critical (high risk, urgent fix needed)
- 2 = Weak (many gaps, below industry standard)
- 3 = Acceptable (meets minimum expectations, needs improvements)
- 4 = Strong (good practice, minor improvements possible)
- 5 = Excellent (industry leading, no action needed)
