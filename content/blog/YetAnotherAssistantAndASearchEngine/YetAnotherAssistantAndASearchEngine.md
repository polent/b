## Yet Another Assistant and a Search Engine?

Once again, we see major companies like Google and OpenAI rolling out their latest offerings. Google introduces Pixie, a new assistant, and OpenAI follows with a brand new search engine. Excited? Perhaps not as much as one might expect.

### Google Pixie

Google's upcoming Pixel 9 smartphones are expected to introduce a new AI assistant named Pixie, powered by their Gemini large language model. Pixie aims to offer a more personalized experience compared to the current Google Assistant, leveraging data from various Google services like Maps and Gmail to perform complex and multimodal tasks. For example, Pixie could analyze a product in a photo and provide directions to the nearest store where it can be purchased.

The Pixel 9 series, including the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro, is set to feature enhancements like Adaptive Touch to boost touch sensitivity, emphasizing user interaction and AI integration. These devices are expected to be smarter, utilizing advanced AI capabilities to differentiate from other Android devices, with Pixie being exclusive to Google's hardware.

### Open AI Search

OpenAI is reportedly preparing to launch its own AI-powered search engine, which is expected to be a significant competitor to Google's search engine. This new search engine from OpenAI is likely to be integrated with ChatGPT, providing a combination of generative AI capabilities and conventional web search functionalities. This integration is anticipated to allow the search engine to deliver AI-generated summaries alongside traditional search results, enhancing the overall user experience with more relevant and contextually informed responses.

The user interface of OpenAI's search engine is expected to be adaptive, showing AI summaries and search results side by side on desktop platforms, while on mobile devices, these might appear sequentially. This approach could enhance accessibility and usability across different devices, providing a seamless experience whether on a phone or a computer.

## Do Assistants Solve a Real Problem?

It's a familiar scenario: companies claim their smart assistants will simplify our lives. However, these gadgets often end up as expensive ornaments that seem more interested in our personal details than in genuinely assisting us.

## OpenAI's Search Engine: Just Another Data Issue?

As OpenAI steps into the competitive arena with its new AI-driven search engine, skepticism arise about its true intent. Could this platform, armed with the power of ChatGPT, simply become another mechanism for data collection rather than a provider of unbiased search results? With its debut set to challenge established giants like Google, this initiative raises concerns about privacy and the potential for manipulative algorithms that prioritize profit over user benefit​.

While the search engine promises enhanced user interactions through AI-generated content, it needs to be seen whether it will respect user privacy or follow the path of existing platforms that harvest user data. The tech community and consumers are watching closely. I may hope for a tool that prioritizes transparency and fairness in the age of information overload. But I may be wrong.

## Big Tech's Profit Machine

These announcements are hardly surprising. Tech giants continuously churn out new products—not to better the world, but to line their pockets. Each new assistant and search engine seems to be another way to harvest and monetize our data.

## Time for a Tech Reality Check

As we encounter a massive stream of new gadgets and search engines, it's important to reflect on their true necessity and impact. Is it time to champion technologies that not only keep the internet as an open platform but also ensure it remains a freely accessible resource, not a luxury marketplace?

We must advocate for a digital future where the web continues to serve as a broad platform for innovation and knowledge-sharing, not just a data-mining field for profit. It's important to support technologies that respect user privacy and offer content freely, rather than transforming our digital spaces into high-cost environments. Not only, but also, as of sustainability reasons. We deserve a digital landscape that prioritizes our needs as users, not just as data sources. Let's demand a future that upholds the openness and accessibility of the internet for everyone.
