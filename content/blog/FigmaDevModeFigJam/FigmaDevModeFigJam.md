## Are You a Figma Fan Like Me?

Then you'll be excited about the latest feature: Dev Mode. Let me share how I use Dev Mode in my design system and why it's a groundbreaking tool for developers.

### What is Dev Mode?

Dev Mode in Figma is a game-changing addition, especially designed for developers. It acts like a browser inspector for your design files, allowing you to easily access dimensions, specifications, styles, and even generate production-ready code snippets for CSS, iOS, or Android directly from your designs.

### Enhancing Your Workflow with Dev Mode

Figma and Dev Mode together streamline your workflow. You can integrate everything from design libraries and your codebase to project management tools within Figma. Dev Mode allows for the incorporation of your tech stack through plugins and ensures consistency between your design files and code.

### Introducing FigJam with AI Capabilities

Alongside Figma, FigJam has introduced AI tools that are transforming collaborative exercises and ideation sessions. FigJam AI, currently in open beta, leverages large language models to enhance your work in FigJam and Figma. It provides functionalities like generating boards for meetings, diagrams, visual timelines, and Gantt charts using simple text prompts. Additionally, you can sort and summarize sticky notes in FigJam, making it easier to categorize and align thoughts after brainstorming sessions.

### Figma for Visual Studio Code

Figma's extension for [Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=figma.figma-vscode-extension) allows you to inspect design files, collaborate with designers, and receive code suggestions, seamlessly blending design and development environments.

### Simplifying Design to Development Transition

Dev Mode facilitates the organization of files and updating of changes, ensuring a smooth transition from design to development. Track changes effortlessly by comparing different versions of a frame.

### Using Jambot in FigJam

Jambot, a FigJam widget powered by ChatGPT's AI, assists in brainstorming, summarizing sticky notes, creating visual mind maps, and more. It enhances the collaborative experience by bringing AI's power to your boards.

### AI Considerations and Best Practices

While AI tools in Figma and [FigJam](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/16822138920343-Use-AI-tools-in-Figma) offer immense possibilities, it's crucial to approach them with an understanding of their limitations in accuracy and responsibilities in data usage. Always verify AI-generated information and adhere to OpenAIâ€™s usage policies.

### AI Features: An Optional Advantage

AI features in FigJam are available on all free and paid plans and can be opted out at any time, giving teams the flexibility to choose their level of AI integration.

### Conclusion

With the introduction of Dev Mode and AI tools in Figma and FigJam, the landscape of design and development is evolving rapidly. These tools are not just about increasing efficiency; they're about redefining how we approach the design and development process.
