# About Me

Welcome to my blog. My name is Holger Hellinger, and I’m the Director of Experience Engineering at [Publicis Sapient](https://www.publicissapient.com/). With over 25 years in technology, I lead global teams to design and deliver scalable, user-focused digital products that connect human creativity with intelligent systems.

This space captures my work and thoughts around responsive, accessible, and performant web experiences built on open standards like HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and Node. I’m deeply involved in modular architectures, Agile delivery, and cross-functional collaboration that turn complexity into clarity and measurable outcomes.

Here I share case studies, architecture notes, and reflections on integrating AI-assisted workflows into modern engineering — from using GitHub Copilot and agentic automation to performance monitoring and design system alignment. The goal is to make technology simpler, smarter, and more sustainable.

Beyond code, this is also about people and craft. I write about mentoring, collaboration, and the tools that help us build consistent and inclusive design systems — from DSM and Figma to Supernova. It’s a glimpse into how we grow and refine Experience Engineering at [Publicis Sapient](https://www.publicissapient.com/) and across the wider tech community.
